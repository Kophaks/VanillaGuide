VanillaGuide
============
VanillaGuide aim to cover the hole for an in-game guide for Vanilla WoW. The AddOn features:

    Step-by-Step Zone Guides (from Joana and Brian Kopps work)
    Hints and Tips for various Quests
    MetaMapBWP Integration
Major change in this fork is color coding for Alliance quests.

Corrected and standardized coords, corrected spelling and tried to make stuff easier to read.

> **To get a better experience, I reccomend getting the following addons aswell**
> - [MetaMap](http://addons.us.to/addon/metamap), works with VanillaGuide to make dots and tracking on map.
> - [Questie](https://github.com/AeroScripts/QuestieDev), great for tracking several quests.
> - [ExtendedQuestLog3](http://addons.us.to/addon/eql3), to get a better overview of your quests.


**NOTE:** This Addon is developed for WoW 1.12.1 (5875), also known as Vanilla WoW, and is being tested and adjusted for Elysium Project/ Zeth'Kur
